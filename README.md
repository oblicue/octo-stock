# octo-stock
A simple, customisable stock manager written in Python using the Polygon API.


## Basic Documentation
So simple it doesn't need much documentation, here it is anyway:

### Starting Out + Installation
1. Clone the git repository and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. Go to **'polygon.io'** and create a new account or login with github. Generate a token.
3. Create a .env file, and add your token into it as **TOKEN**. Your .env file should be in the same directory as your main.py file.
4. Done!
Once everything is installed, you can run the python file.
From here, you will see a basic CLI.
You can use the arrow keys to go up/down, and enter to select an option.
The names are pretty descriptive, e.g showwatchlist will show all stocks on your watch list.
Nothing is permanent and you can always revert by opening watchlist.json or using the (soon to be added!) removefromwatchlist command.

Just have a toy around and see what you can do!
